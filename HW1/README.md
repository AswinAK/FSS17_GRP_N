## HW1 - Reading CSV files

### Description
Read each line, kill whitepsace and anything after comment characters (#), break each line on comma, read rows into a list of lists (one list per row), converting strings to numbers where appropriate. Note that some column headers contain ?: all such columns should be ignored. For now you can ignore the other magic characters in row1.  
Your code should contain checks for bad lines (and bad lines should be skipped over); i.e. symbols where numbers should be and wrong number of cells (we will say that row1 has the “right” length).  

### Files
`a.py` - python code for HW1  
`output.txt` - Table generated by the code in a.py  
`POM3a.csv` - Large dataset with valid and invalid data  
`test.csv` - Small dataset with valid and invalid data   

### Dependencies
`Python 2.7`

### Building
`python a.py <inputfile>`  
For example `python a.py POM3a.csv`
